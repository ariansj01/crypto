        "user_psychology": "Your profile indicates a strong desire for financial gains through cryptocurrency investment, with a particular interest in decentralized technologies. However, you also exhibit clear risk-averse tendencies, as evidenced by your quick sell reaction to profits and concern about potential losses. This cautious approach is further highlighted by your low acceptance rate and limited time commitment. Contradictions emerge between your trust in decentralized projects and your avoidance of eco-friendly initiatives, possibly due to a perception of higher risk or complexity. Overall, you are motivated by the potential rewards but approach the market with a measured, opportunistic mindset, influenced by social media trends and a desire for easy access.",
        "strategic_advice": "Given your risk profile and time constraints, it is essential to strike a balance between capital preservation and exploring the DeFi space. Consider allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to stablecoins, providing a stable base with near-zero volatility. You can then use the remaining funds to invest in established, low-maintenance DeFi projects, such as lending protocols. This strategy aligns with your interest in blockchain infrastructure and provides a more passive approach to crypto investing. Additionally, consider setting up price alerts to take advantage of quick profit opportunities without constant monitoring.",
